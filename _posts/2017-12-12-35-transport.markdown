Carlton Towers is not well served by public transport and is best accessed by car. There is plenty of parking available and vehicles may be left overnight for collection the next day. Whilst there is no Uber service in the area, there are several local taxi firms depending on where your Saturday evening accommodation is.

**Note that all taxis will require an advance booking and will not accept calls on the day**
